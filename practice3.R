# Q : Which airline has the highest number of delayed departures?
#
# 1. Since you want to consider all the flights from a particular airline (based on the carrier feature), 
# you will first want to group the data by that feature.
# 2. You need to figure out the largest number of delayed departures (based on the dep_delay feature)â€”
# which means you need to find the flights that were delayed (filtering for them).
# 3. You can take the found flights and aggregate them into a count (summarize the different groups).
# 4. You will then need to find which group has the highest count (filtering).
# 5. Finally, you can choose (select) the airline of that group.

# Identify the airline (`carrier`) that has the highest number of
# delayed flights
has_most_delays <- flights %>%            # start with the flights
  group_by(carrier) %>%                   # group by airline (carrier)
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>%               # find only the delays
  summarize(num_delay = n()) %>%          # count the observations
  filter(num_delay == max(num_delay)) %>% # find most delayed
  select(carrier)                         # select the airline
has_most_delays

head(airlines)

# Get name of the most delayed carrier
most_delayed_name <- has_most_delays %>%  # start with the previous answer
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% # join on airline ID
  select(name)                            # select the airline name

# 2.On average, to which airport do flights arrive most early?

  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay)) # compute mean delay

head(most_early)

# Identify the destination where flights, on average, arrive most early
most_early <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>% # group by destination
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # compute mean delay
  filter(delay == min(delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # filter for least delayed
  select(dest, delay) %>% # select the destination (and delay to store it)
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% # join on `airports` data
  select(dest, name, delay) # select output variables of interest
